## Database configurations go here
database:
  ## platform denotes the database platform on which the ITM will persist the data. It can be either oracle,
  ## postgresql
  platform: postgresql
  ## OPTIONAL field to create a namespace scoped database instance for the service. If this is not enabled, it is
  ## understood that the service will use a shared/common database

  connectionConfig:
    connectionUrl: jdbc:postgresql://wplat-psqldb:5432/wplat1-3
    ## In general we have to use the credentials from the secrets created in the namespace. This shall be followed in all the clusters
    credentials:
      secrets:
        secretName: mycompany-wplat-database-credentials
        ## name of the secret key that contains the username of the database
        userNameKey: username
        ## name of the secret key that contains the password of the username
        passwordKey: password
      ## OPTIONAL: in production we will not use the plain text form of credentials. This is available for the development purpose
      plainText: {}
        # username: someusername
        # password: somepassword
