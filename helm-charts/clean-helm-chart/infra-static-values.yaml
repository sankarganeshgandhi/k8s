## This is a YAML-formatted file.
## Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

## The Helm chart and values provide the base set of resources and configuration values required for the service 
## application. The base values needs to be overridden to reflect the target environment specific values. If you need
## additional kubernetes resources that are not part of this Helm chart, please create them with appropriate tools like
## kustomize.

## - THIS SECTION IS FOR CONFIGURATIONS THAT DO NOT CHANGE IN MOST OF THE CASES                                    - ##

serviceAccount:
  ## Specifies whether a service account should be created
  create: true
  ## Annotations to add to the service account
  annotations: {}
  ## The name of the service account to use.
  ## If not set and create is true, a name is generated using the fullname template

  ## We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  ## choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  ## resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  ## lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
